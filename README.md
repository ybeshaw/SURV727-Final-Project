# HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND TECHNOLOGY for HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 AND 2030  
SURV727 FINAL PROJECT
This project aims to analyze the volume of coverage regarding the Health Communication and Technology Objectives of Healthy People Agendas 2020 and 2030. For the purposes of this project, 
“coverage” encompasses Google search trends, news media coverage, and congressional bills related to these objectives.  This project utilizes the gtrendsR package to assess results related to 
keywords associated with these objectives from Google Trends.  Additionally, it utilizes the Dow Jones Factiva API to scrape articles that include the keywords and lastly, it observes how many 
bills were introduced in Congress related to these topics. This project compares the volume of coverage for objectives between both agendas and across their respective progression status.
